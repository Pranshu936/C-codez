# Beginner's Guide to Learning C and Python Programming

Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to Learning C and Python Programming! Whether you're new to programming or looking to expand your skills, this repository is designed to help you get started with two powerful programming languages: C and Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:

- **C Compiler:** If you're using Windows, you can install MinGW or Cygwin to compile C programs. On macOS and Linux, the GCC compiler usually comes pre-installed.
- **Python Interpreter:** Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager like `apt` or `brew` for Linux/macOS.

### Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beginner-c-python.git
cd beginner-c-python
```
